# Jacks

## Pipeline

> __NOTE:__ Pipeline Jack command list are only visible when the view has the `groovy` language mode set. In order to execute a pipeline, you also must be editing a local file.

### Execute

Builds the current Pipeline `groovy` file/script you are editing on your remote Jenkins, using the name of the file as the name of the job the extension will reference.

If the job doesn't exist, the user will be presented with an option of creating the job on the remote host. If the job _does_ exist, it will update the job's pipeline script (nothing else) and run the build as usual.

The job's build output will stream to your editor's Output window with some syntax highlighting created specifically for generic Pipeline logs.

If parameters are added to the job on Jenkins, the extensions will add these to the `.<FILE>.config.json` file, which can be edited for executing your Pipeline with targeted paramter values.

### Update

Updates the remote Jenkins Pipeline job with the `groovy` file's source/script.

### Abort

Aborts a streaming pipeline build (if one is active).

### Shared Library Reference

Provides a searchable list of the available Pipeline Shared Library steps/vars. When a selection is made, the user will be presented with the markdown documentation of the step/var pulled and parsed from the remote Jenkins (no snippets currently).

## Script Console

> __NOTE:__ This jack's commands are only visible when the view has the `groovy` language mode set. Unlike the Pipeline Jack, you don't need a saved file in order to execute your script remotely.

### Execute

Executes the current `groovy` file/script, you are editing, on the remote jenkins, targeting either the System (e.g. Manage Jenkins Script Console) or multiple nodes/slaves/agents/etc.

## Build
